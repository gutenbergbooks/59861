<p class="p2 noi works"><span class="smcap">Gentlemen of the Bunker Hill Monument Association</span>:</p>

<p>It is a matter of regret to me that other engagements have
compelled my absence from your meetings the two years past,
but your printed proceedings upon those occasions were full
of interest and contributed material of importance to the
student of Revolutionary literature.</p>

<p>The Treasurer’s Report shows that the financial condition
of the Association is good, although the erection of the new
Lodge increases the expenses in much the same proportion
that it adds to the comfort of visitors. The most pressing
need of the Association is that of a larger permanent fund
to improve the grounds and keep the buildings in proper
and attractive condition.</p>

<p>During the year ten members of our Association have
passed away, and one of our Directors, Mr. Richard Devens.
They were earnest, active citizens, proud of their heritage,
and in their respective fields of work added to the well-being
and moral strength of this community. We shall miss them
from our membership, but to those who take their places we
extend a cordial welcome, confident that the patriotic memories
clustering round the 17th of June will inspire them to
follow closely in the footsteps of their predecessors.</p>

<p>The year’s panorama has unfolded a varied picture, with
incidents both of encouragement and of warning. While it
has not been a year of marked prosperity, and while accidents
by flood and fire have caused terrible losses and suffering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
our country has pursued a peaceful and progressive course,
and no complications of a dangerous nature have actively
threatened. The settlement by arbitration of the Alaskan
Question and the Venezuelan troubles is a matter for congratulation,
irrespective of the terms of settlement. The
assurance of the building of the Panama Canal is of the
first importance, not only because it closes a vexed question,
but for its effect in changing and opening up new avenues
of trade and in knitting together different parts of this Union
of States. The final step in its accomplishment will probably
always be subject to criticism and discussion, but rightful
authority having settled the fact that the Canal is to be built,
no one will question its desirability and usefulness.</p>

<p>The most perplexing problems before the country are, as
they have long been, those connected with the continual strife
between capital and labor, and it is singular and not altogether
encouraging that such conditions should exist and
seemingly grow worse in a country affording boundless
opportunity for both laboring man and capitalist and where
the chances for progress and improvement are so great.
One would think that here, if anywhere, justification was
wanting for class feeling, for jealousies, or for violent breach
of the laws.</p>

<p>The constant succession of strikes retards progress, imperils
business interests, and brings suffering and disaster to those
concerned and to parties having no immediate connections
with the strife. The growing strength of the labor unions
would not be a subject of regret was it not too often
accompanied by a dictatorial and narrow spirit infringing
upon the rights of the individual man and frequently leading
to public disorder and violation of law. As an educating
force to its members the Union is of value, and equally
so as a protection for the just rights of labor, but its members
should never forget that the public peace must be preserved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
at all hazards, that no grievances can be enforced by violence,
and that the rights of non-union men are just as sacred and
inviolate as those of men who band themselves together for a
common purpose. Liberty is a myth, and despotism usurps
its place, unless the individual man may use his own judgment
and work where and when he pleases for what he deems
sufficient wage without violent interference by others; he may
be persuaded, he may be influenced, but no man or body of
men have the right to use force. Despotism is despotism,
whether under forms of labor unions or capitalistic combinations,
and a trust in labor may be just as oppressive and
dangerous as a trust to restrict production, affect prices, or
for any other purpose, even more so in its tendency to lead to
open violence.</p>

<p>The great public having no connection with particular combinations
must always be considered, and it will not patiently
submit to interruption of public traffic or to the lessening of
its comforts or conveniences while jarring interests are settling
their private quarrels. Public legislation should be
impartial in the sense that it should be directed towards
bettering conditions and repairing injustice to all classes of
people, but none should be enacted except with the understanding
that peace is always to be preserved and that the
wrongs of special parties shall not be redressed at the expense
of the rights of the community as a whole.</p>

<p>Outside of our country it is not a cheering prospect that,
despite Hague Conferences and all efforts to promote peace
between nations, the opening years of this Twentieth Century
witness a disastrous and bloody war between great empires of
the West and East, and upon questions that seem to involve
little else than extensions of territory at the expense of other
nations. However sympathies may be divided between the
two contending parties, we must all hope that the war may
not be of long duration, and that the awful waste, sacrifice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
slaughter may tend to discourage such barbarous methods and
to spread the principles of peaceful arbitration.</p>

<p>The military spirit prevailing everywhere, even in our own
country, and the apotheosis of force, requiring such enormous
military and naval appropriations, give food for thought, and
in this connection we may well consider whether the alarming
increase of crime, the lynchings at the South and West, and
the disregard of law in many high quarters, are not the natural
result of such a spirit. The Devil’s advocates are uncommonly
busy, and if Christian preachers believe in the Gospel of Peace,
they have a wide field for Christian work. He who talks of
war as anything but a curse to a nation and a crime against
humanity should remember these words of General Sherman,
who knew what war was: “I confess without shame that I am
tired and sick of the war. Its glory is all moonshine. Even
success, the most brilliant, is over dead and mangled bodies,
the anguish and lamentation of distant families appealing to
me for missing sons, husbands, and fathers. It is only those
who have not heard a shot, nor heard the shrieks and groans
of the wounded and lacerated (friend or foe), that cry aloud
for more blood, more vengeance, more desolation.”</p>

<p>The Peace Conference, to be held in Boston in the Fall, is a
hopeful sign; for this Republic above all others should stand
for peace, and this Association and all patriotic societies
which venerate the Founders of this Republic and believe
that the principles they advocated lead to peace and amity
between nations can contribute to the hastening of the time
when armaments shall be reduced and the reign of peace in
the world be brought nearer.</p>

<p>To that end, in the short space of time allotted me to-day,
I desire to call your attention to what our Fathers believed as
illustrated by their own words, and I turn back by way of
text to the interview I once before referred to, which our late
member Judge Chamberlain narrated that he had with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Captain Preston, who fought at Lexington, and who, when
over ninety years of age, could recall no reason for going into
the fight other than that America had always governed herself
and always meant to.</p>

<p>We may seek for hidden causes of the Revolution—we may
ascribe it to this or that violation of rights or liberties, but
reduced to its ultimate the old soldier probably summed it
up pretty much as it presented itself to the ordinary mind
at the time, and expressed in a general way the feeling that
actuated the masses of the revolutionists. Few had the time,
the power, or the desire to reason the matter out, or to
form definite ideas of what the trouble was or what they
wanted.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with the stated causes for revolt, but
they were the excitement of the moment as compared with
the pride of conscious strength and the desire America had
to be left alone to work out her own problems.</p>

<p>The special grievances, the principles in dispute brought
forth the great leaders, but probably their minds were less
influenced by them than they imagined, and back of all was
the feeling only partially recognized that America was a
nation and needed no instruction or guidance from abroad.
Of course they did not say that, they were honest in the
beginning in disclaiming any idea of independence; they did,
with rare exceptions, honestly look forward to a reconciliation
with the mother country; but all the while, though they did not
see it then, the terms of reconciliation formulated in their
minds were impossible of attainment in any other way than
by independence.</p>

<p>It does not impugn their good faith or wisdom that like all
great leaders of revolutions they failed to estimate the force
of the current bearing them on; but it is plain to our eyes
that a revolt in the name of the King against the Parliament
to establish rights that King and Parliament alike desired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
withhold was a fiction which in the nature of things could
only be temporary, and which the first clash of arms was
certain to dissipate into thin air. Events moved too fast for
men’s control, and independence came because no other result
than that of absolute submission was possible.</p>

<p>Consider for a moment how rapidly at last America drifted
towards revolution and separation, and how each step forward,
as usual, lopped off the hesitating and timid, and made it
more and more difficult for the bolder leaders to retrace their
path.</p>

<p>In 1761 James Otis struck the keynote in his great argument
against the writs of assistance,—the general principles
of independence which operated later were then so clearly
enunciated that the people caught the breath of freedom, and
the unrest and turmoil and frequent outbreaks during the
nine years following showed that the lesson could not be
unlearned.</p>

<p>March 5, 1770, came the Boston Massacre on State Street,
the first conflict of the Revolution, in which the people
were stricken down by murderous bullets; December 16,
1773, the mob openly defied British law by throwing the
tea overboard in Boston Harbor; May, 1774, General Gage
arrived in Boston to assume the position of Royal Governor,
and was escorted from Long Wharf to the Town
House in King, now State, Street by the Boston Cadets,
under the command of John Hancock, probably the last
act of loyalty to Great Britain by the Corps or its
officers; June 1, 1774, the Port of Boston was closed by
Act of Parliament; September, 1774, the Continental Congress
or Conference of States gathered at Philadelphia; October
5, 1774, the Massachusetts House of Representatives met
at Salem, summoned by Governor Gage, and being notified
that their meeting was revoked, immediately constituted
themselves a Provincial Congress, assumed administration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and passed orders for putting the Province into a condition for
defence,—the winter passed in fruitless disputes with the
Governor and Royal officers, but the Congress was busy with
active and positive work nearly approaching rebellion; April
19, 1775, the natural result came in the fight at Lexington
and Concord, fairly opening the Revolution, and followed by
the gathering of a large army of half-armed troops at Cambridge
to besiege Boston, the Continental Congress finding a
commander for them in the person of George Washington;
May 10, 1775, Ticonderoga and Crown Point were taken by
force; on June 17, 1775, before Washington had reached the
army, Bunker Hill was fought; March 17, 1776, Boston was
evacuated by the British, the scene of action was transferred
to a larger field at New York, and then, July 4, 1776, came
the time to write the Revolution into the Declaration of Independence,
so that the world might behold the new nation and
find also a government with a novelty, one that based itself
upon certain ideal truths, and thus differentiated the American
Revolution from all preceding revolutions.</p>

<p>However old the subject may be, and however hopeless the
thought of adding anything new to the discussion, it may still
be interesting to consider this extraordinary Declaration from
a purely historical standpoint, and to revive our recollections
of its truths, as well as to consider how far in reality they were
intended to go. As no political party has any proprietorship
in those truths, and no party has yet taken a position in opposition
to them, we can freely discuss them in the hope of
clarifying our view of the deeper meaning of the Revolution.
Present conditions are not to be considered in this discussion,
we are now concerned only with the question of the permanent
or transitory nature of the document itself, and of its
effectiveness as a rule of national conduct.</p>

<p>Separating from the Declaration its catalogue of specific
and temporary reasons for revolt, its whole purport is to set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
forth—the natural freedom and equality of all men before
the law; the fundamental right of those governed to pass
upon the form of government they shall live under, and to
subvert it if not satisfactory; and the right of all men to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,—this last phrase seeming
a broad generalization capable of wide interpretation.</p>

<p>No one of these doctrines was original with the signers,
and the Committee reporting the Declaration made no pretence
to have originated them. Every principle had been
stated and advocated long before by European philosophers
and writers,—and the claim has been made that the Declaration
itself bore a strong resemblance to that of the United
Netherlands,—but it was the first practical application of
such principles to an actual system of popular government.
The author of the Declaration said in later years, “I did
not consider it as any part of my charge to invent new ideas
altogether, and to offer no sentiment which had ever been
expressed before.”</p>

<p>It may properly be regarded, therefore, as a crystallization
of old theories, and as such its promulgation excited
surprise in Europe, mingled with a good deal of skepticism
as to its being a working basis for government or as to
the possibility of adherence to it in practice. This feeling
was a natural one, for if its doctrines were true and extended
elsewhere the prospect was dark for theories of the
divine right of kings, of despotic power, or even of current
monarchical systems; and therein lies the very pith of the
Declaration, and it was no wonder that when the seeds sown
here ripened a little later in France and the bloody revolution
there ended in a military despotism the prophets of evil
quickly seized upon the result as a practical test and welcome
proof of the absurdity of our position.</p>

<p>In the Orient it made no impression and in fact had no
meaning, for such theories were not within the Oriental conception;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
nor are they now so far as they spell Republicanism.</p>

<p>Dr. Edward Everett Hale recently sent a letter to an United
States Senator, which well represents how such doctrines
impress the Oriental mind, and is worth quoting as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When Commodore Perry opened the ports of Japan the
Japanese Government had in prison a young fellow from Washington
Territory who had been shipwrecked on their coast,—he
was in prison only because he was a foreigner. They cross-examined
him and asked him what officer in our government held higher rank
than the men they knew. He said the officers of the Navy had to
obey the Secretary of the Navy, and that he was under the President.
They asked him who was greater than the President. This
boy said that ‘the people is greater than the Presidency,’ and in
giving the account of this afterward he said, ‘of this they could
make nothing.’”</p></div>

<p>In other words, “a government of the people for the people
and by the people” was not within their purview.</p>

<p>When the Declaration was signed and issued to the country
as a platform for a new nation, it can hardly be doubted that
its doctrines were believed by its authors, and by those who
accepted it, to be applicable to every people and to all times,—notwithstanding
the recognized fact that unfortunate conditions
here regarding African slavery revealed an apparent
inconsistency.</p>

<p>How far the words of the Declaration applied to negro
slaves will always be disputed, but that Jefferson intended
no exception is to be gathered from his oft-quoted expressions,
and from the fact that in the original draft the British
Government were severely condemned for establishing slavery
here and not repressing the slave trade. The historian
Bancroft expressed in his history the Jeffersonian view,
saying, “The heart of Thomas Jefferson in writing the
Declaration, and of Congress in adopting it, beat for all
humanity; the assertion of right was made for all mankind
and all coming generations, without any exception whatever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
for the proposition which admits of exceptions can never be
self-evident.”</p>

<p>It should be added that at that time, North and South, it
was the opinion that slavery would soon disappear, and it
was only unforeseen inventions which changed the situation.
But taking whatever view we please of the intention
of the makers in this regard, there can be no question that
the Declaration announced important and high ideals for the
future. Jefferson emphasized this when he said, “It is indeed
an animating thought that while we are securing the rights
of ourselves and our posterity we are pointing out the way
to struggling nations who wish like us to emerge from their
tyrannies also,” and again, “Every man and every body of
men on earth possesses the right of self government. They
receive it with their being from the hand of nature.” And so
Charles Sumner later said, “The words that governments
derive their just powers from the consent of the governed are
sacred words, full of life-giving energy. Not simply national
independence was here proclaimed, but also the primal rights
of all mankind.” Abraham Lincoln said, “In these early
days the Declaration of Independence was held sacred by
all and thought to include all;” and again, “If that Declaration
is not the truth, let us get the Statute book in which we
find it and tear it out.” These statements have been echoed
and re-echoed by all our great statesmen, from Washington
and Adams and Jefferson to Webster, Sumner, and Lincoln;
they have even been asserted more than once in political
platforms of great parties, and wherever the voice of dissent
was feebly raised and doubters found, it was until recent
times invariably among the apologists for slavery, or among
those who feared interference with it, never by the men whom
we of the present day look upon as leaders, or whose interpretation
we would ever have been willing to follow.</p>

<p>No one assumes that the Signers foresaw all the temptations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and difficulties likely to arise as the nation grew stronger,—that
was as impossible as for their wildest dreams to compass
its marvellous growth; but they knew full well that the doctrines
they asserted would have to meet severe tests and their
sublime confidence in the virtue and constancy of the people
is the more manifest that they were willing to take the risk of
future conditions. If they were wrong in those doctrines,
how can we avoid the conclusion that they have been given
greater credit for wisdom and foresight than they were justly
entitled to, or that the wisdom of all our great statesmen is
impugned, who for so many years have asserted and boasted
of the truths set forth.</p>

<p>What the Revolutionary statesmen urged upon the people
as fundamental truths were endorsed as such for more than a
century, yet if they were mere phrases or visionary theories,
the eloquence and statesmanship of all the great statesmen
before our day or in our day, until within a few years, goes
for nought.</p>

<p>Rufus Choate, to be sure, in the stress of a political campaign
urging the claims to the Presidency of James Buchanan,
termed the Declaration “glittering and sounding generalities
of natural right;” but this was looked upon as exuberant
rhetoric, and the expression was never taken seriously by the
country, nor accepted as a matured opinion in contravention
of the main doctrines of the Declaration.</p>

<p>More recently men of standing and character have apparently
adopted and even extended Choate’s theory,—it has
been maintained that governments rest upon the consent of
<em>some</em> of the governed, and this is true and not apart from the
Declaration if it means that governments rest upon the will
of the majority, for that carries with it the right of all to
be heard,—but it is absolutely foreign to the Declaration if
by “some of the governed” is intended only the more enlightened
part of the people,—that is, the minority,—for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
then it upholds a theory differing not at all from that of an
oligarchy, or even a despotism, and does not represent popular
government as we have understood it.</p>

<p>It has been said also that the Declaration applied only to
civilized peoples, intelligent enough to maintain Republican
government, or to those of sufficient capacity to govern themselves
and to better themselves by such self-government, or
even farther, that the Declaration is untrue as a general
proposition and only applied to the existing situation in
America in 1776.</p>

<p>No such qualifying phrases can be found in the Declaration
itself, and if such were in the minds of the statesmen of the
day it is passing strange that men who had the power to
express themselves in so lucid and straightforward a way
never hinted then or thereafter at any such limitations.</p>

<p>It certainly was not the view of the Continental Congress
when at the end of the war it said, “Let it be remembered
that it has ever been the pride and boast of America that the
rights for which she contended were the rights of human
nature,” and the historic glory of the American Revolution is
immensely lessened if we accept the Declaration with qualifications,
for on such a theory nothing was established by that war
except the ability of the Revolutionists, with the aid of France,
to bring the rebellion to a successful conclusion, and to establish
here a Republic, the Declaration becoming to the rest of
the world of academic interest only as a skilfully worded
statement of provincial grievances. We all must desire to
ascertain if possible whether those who hold the theories I
have stated are correct, and whether our predecessors have
been cherishing illusory and transitory principles or eternal
truths, for if the former are right our compass now points in
a new direction, and we may as well change our course to
correspond, even though we reach the well-worn track that
European nations have been following since we originally
steered away from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a prevalent belief, and with some it accounts for
the novelty of recent views, that the Declaration prescribed a
Republican form of government as essential for every people,
but such is not the fact, as is evident from these words in the
document:</p>

<p>“Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
these ends (referring to the rights and liberties of the people),
it is the right of the people to alter and abolish it, and to constitute
a new government, laying its foundations on such principles
and <em>organizing its powers in such form</em> as to them shall
seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Prudence,
indeed, will dictate that long-established governments
should not be changed for light and transient causes.”</p>

<p>Washington expressed this in brief and cogent form as
follows: “Every nation has a right to establish that form
of government under which it conceives it may live most
happy.”</p>

<p>The equality before the law asserted in the Declaration
never implied equality of intelligence or opportunity, nor did
it necessarily imply universal suffrage as a fixed principle.
Between 1776, when the Declaration was issued, and 1789, the
time of the adoption of the Constitution, there were in the
thirteen States various forms of government, and none of
them with universal suffrage. A free people may see fit to
restrict or enlarge their own rights; they may confer extreme
power upon appointed rulers, or retain all power to themselves,—whichever
course is pursued, if it be the people’s
unrestricted action, it is in no way inconsistent with the
Declaration. Of course this excludes absolutely and forever
any idea of a controlling influence by an outside power, or
that there can be any such thing as self-government, unless a
people are left free to determine for themselves the form and
methods of their own government. To those who wrote the
Declaration self-government and independence were interconvertible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
terms, and the burden is upon those who would now
distinguish them to invent new definitions. The Declaration
did not proclaim that every people in the world were fitted for
a Republican form of government,—that form was unquestionably
the ideal of the fathers, but the essence of the document
was that each nation must determine for itself what
form it preferred, and so long as the people were freely consulted,
and reserved the right to change when their interests
were not properly served, the principles were not infringed
upon. This was to be entirely independent of the form
adopted; it might be a limited monarchy like England, an
armed Republic like France, a Greek, Roman, or South American
Republic, a military dictatorship like Mexico, or even a
popular despotism like the early days of the Napoleonic
empires. The modern idea that fitness was to be determined
by some foreign superior nation had not been thought of
in 1776.</p>

<p>Take a concrete case like the England of to-day, excluding,
of course, her colonies—her ideals may not be the same as
ours, but it would be a hazardous statement to make that
the rights of the people as set forth in our Declaration are not
preserved in England in their full significance quite as well as
in our own boss-ridden states and cities. England has a
monarchy in form, but a people’s monarchy, and subject to
the people’s will, and it may well be questioned whether the
people there do not express their will with quite as much
facility as here. In many places in this country we have a
practical and vulgar despotism under the forms of a Republic,—the
people can and do assert themselves when thoroughly
aroused, but they are long suffering, and only when the
bossism becomes too flagrant and offensive can they be led
to enforce that equality before the law and to exhibit that
latent power which is necessary to prove that genuine Republicanism
still exists.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>In dealing with our Indian tribes the government has proceeded
upon the theory that they were nations, they have
not been taxed, and although our treatment of them has not
been creditable, our theories have been consistent; still, I
have no idea that the framers of the Declaration believed that
these tribes, or Oriental nations, or any semi-civilized peoples
were fitted for a Republic, or that for them such a form would
be wise or safe; but they did not lose sight of it as the
ultimate for every people, and believed that it could only
be attained by every people working out their own salvation
and by that governmental evolution which through struggle
and hardship alone leads to a higher and more stable form.
Secretary Hay once incisively expressed it thus: “No people
are fit for anything else than self-government,” and it was an
eminent Frenchman who truly said, “You cannot have a
Republic without Republicans.”</p>

<p>Given the capacity to form <em>some</em> government and you have
all the conditions necessary for improvement, and in the
Providence of God a people can better be trusted to improve
itself than it can to gain in self-government under the subjection
of others.</p>

<p>Applying these principles as our fathers stated them, and
as they applied them, unless in the case of slavery, and
remembering that their sin in that case, however, much forced
by their situation, was atoned for from 1861 to 1865 in blood
and treasure, the problems relating to inferior races become
greatly simplified, for the “white man’s burden” ceases to be
war and subjection and becomes a Christian principle in
recognizing as the sole right of the stronger his duty to assist
and encourage the weaker in the struggle to preserve such
government as suits him best and for which he deems himself
best fitted.</p>

<p>Abandoning the principles of the Declaration, the white
man’s burden means to the black or yellow man political
slavery and wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Even the Anglo-Saxon, with all his success in many
respects, as a colonist, has utterly failed to lead an inferior
race up to self-government—he may have carried with him
some material advantages, but his assumed and vaunted
burden cannot be separated from his love of power and
soaring ambition.</p>

<p>His dominating superiority makes him a hard master of
another race, and he fails utterly in sympathetic appreciation
of racial differences and characteristics.</p>

<p>No one can dispute his marvellous capacity, the forcefulness
of his dealings, and in many cases his patient, earnest attempt
to better the conditions of those whom he rules; but he never
has accepted nor understood the peculiar natures of his subjects
nor enlisted their sympathies or affections. Without
intending to be cruel, his cool assumption of the power to
remake people and force them into his own mould has led him
into errors which have caused great hardship and have ended
in estrangement and hatred.</p>

<p>Neither material prosperity nor orderly government wins
the hearts or permanently changes the habits of peoples
whose traditions have been interfered with and whose imaginative
and fickle natures have not been taken into account.
A foreign government remains forever foreign to a people
whose love has not been gained, and who are made to feel that
they are inferior and never to be on terms of full equality
with their masters.</p>

<p>No more conspicuous instance can be found than in the
condition of India after a century and a half of English rule,
much of it by excellent men of great capacity and strength,
and of honest intention. It began with the rule of the sword,
and to-day it is nothing else,—it has not led the people
towards self-government, nor has it succeeded in inspiring
confidence and affection,—stripped of the thin veneer of
civilization which has been spread over the land, the conqueror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and the conquered still face each other as ever alien
and hostile races, the conquered hating their masters, and
sullenly biding their time for revolt, and the conqueror holding
them down by force and fear only. The gulf between the
races is as broad as ever, and everything indicates that a
withdrawal of British power would be followed by a temporary
return to much the former conditions of semi-barbarism,
until something better was evolved by struggle and
experience, aided now by the bright example of a neighboring
power.</p>

<p>Egypt, which on the surface shows good results, has done
little but exchange a Turkish for an English ruler, so far a
gain, for it has been followed by an apparent advance in
material prosperity and a lightening of the burdens, but it is
not easy to ascertain how far the prosperity has really benefited
the people; and remembering that Egypt was once the
centre of advanced civilization, it is by no means proved that
as a free people they would not have been further on the road
towards a hopeful self-government.</p>

<p>If we look to the Dutch colonies in Asia, we find at best
a condition of peonage and political servitude and a war that
has had little cessation in fifty years. There again it is force
and fear and not self-government. In German, French, or
Russian colonies no one seeks for self-government, and the
hopelessness of their situation is that neither fraternization
with the people exists nor improvement of conditions by
emigration from the ruling countries.</p>

<p>To point the contrast, and to evidence the truth of the principles
of the Declaration, we may well consider the rising
empire of Japan, inhabited by a people differing but little from
the neighboring races, a century ago not far removed from
barbarism, pagan in religion, though tolerant, Asiatic in habits
and thought, self-governed and independent because it has been
left to work out its own problems, yet now by its own energy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
advancing towards civilization and Christianity, and rapidly
becoming a great power in the East. No stronger exemplification
can be found of the principle that a people is better fitted
for self-government than any other, and that its own experience
and efforts offer better tutelage than the wisest and most
beneficent rule of foreign masters.</p>

<p>The plans of statesmen, the ambition of nations may come
into conflict with the doctrines of the Declaration, but they are
of no concern as compared with the truth or falsity of the
principles it contains. If it is not to be followed as a standard
of governmental ethics, and is a visionary statement of
unpractical theories, we seem somehow to have lost our bearings,
and to have parted with our guiding lights. No true
American, whatever his party allegiance, can avoid or lightly
treat these important questions, nor can the right solution come
from a consultation of his interests or prejudices, nor from
any source other than the experience of the years since 1776,
and a careful consideration of the wisdom or folly of the
teachings of those who have made this country what it is. No
day can better emphasize these thoughts than this anniversary,
and if in avoiding anything of a partisan nature I have
willingly laid myself open to the charge of triteness, let us
remember that the trite things of this world are often of the
most importance, and the more familiar they are, the more
apt they are to be disregarded or forgotten. They cannot be
foreign to the purposes of this meeting, for although the
original parchment of the Declaration at Washington has faded
out, the principles of this most important and startling of State
Papers will always be living light, and if the day should ever
come when it would be unbecoming to discuss them here, one
of the great purposes of this Association would have been
lost, and the nature of our people and our theory of government
changed.</p>

<p>When Daniel Webster with his masterly eloquence evolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from his imagination the great speech of John Adams upon
the Declaration, he could have had in his mind no qualifying
phrases, no doubts as to the eternal truths which were proclaimed,
and no question but that independence was the ideal
for and the right of every nation of the earth; otherwise his
words failed to ring true, and he never could have closed with
such statements as these:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Read this Declaration at the head of the army, every sword
will be drawn from its scabbard and the solemn vow uttered to
maintain it or perish on the bed of honor. Publish it from the
pulpit, religion will approve it and the love of religious liberty
will cling round it, resolved to stand with it or fall with it; send
it to the public halls,—proclaim it there,—let them hear it who
first heard the roar of the enemy’s cannon,—let them see it who
saw their brothers and their sons fall on the field of Bunker Hill
and in the streets of Lexington and Concord, and the very walls
will cry out in its support.</i>”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
